Here, a list of the main C components and feature, listed more or less by difficul level (first easier , last more advanced).
Keep in mind that this list if not just by 'topic' but some point are just specified to take your attention of a particula feature
of the language that is controversial, different, unexpected or simply requires more attention (hence, need to be studied!).

Also, is not **EVERYTHING** specific to the *C* language, some stuff are just some generic *Software Developer* stuff but are required to 
move forward with the language, or, especially if you have experience with other programing languages, to see how is done in C rather.
