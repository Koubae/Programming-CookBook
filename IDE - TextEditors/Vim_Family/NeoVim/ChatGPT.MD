### can i start with NvbChad and switch to lazyvim later? How to tell neovim to use one manager or the other?? is ther a switch?


Yes ‚Äî you can start with NvChad and switch to LazyVim later, but they‚Äôre mutually exclusive setups, not something you can "switch between" on the fly from inside Neovim. Think of them more like entire prebuilt environments or ‚Äúframeworks‚Äù ‚Äî kind of like choosing between two Linux distros.

üîß How does Neovim know what to load?
Neovim loads configuration from:

bash
Copy
Edit
~/.config/nvim
Both NvChad and LazyVim install their full config into this same folder.

So the answer is:

‚úÖ There is no runtime switch.
You either have NvChad installed in ~/.config/nvim, or LazyVim, or your own config.

üîÑ How to switch between them
Here are a few approaches:

Option 1: Rename config folders manually
bash
Copy
Edit
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim-nvchad
mv ~/.config/nvim-lazyvim ~/.config/nvim
And vice versa.

Option 2: Use a symlink to swap easily
bash
Copy
Edit
# Have two setups:
~/.config/nvim-nvchad/
~/.config/nvim-lazyvim/

# Create a symlink
ln -s ~/.config/nvim-nvchad ~/.config/nvim
When you want to switch:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/.config/nvim-lazyvim ~/.config/nvim
Option 3: Use a launcher script
Write a small shell script like:

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$1" == "lazy" ]; then
  ln -sf ~/.config/nvim-lazyvim ~/.config/nvim
elif [ "$1" == "nvchad" ]; then
  ln -sf ~/.config/nvim-nvchad ~/.config/nvim
fi

nvim
üßπ Pro Tip
If you're experimenting, version control your configs (e.g., in a ~/.dotfiles repo), so you can backtrack or merge ideas later. Both LazyVim and NvChad support easy customization through specific folders (lua/custom/, etc.).

üì¶ Summary
Feature	NvChad	LazyVim
Location	~/.config/nvim	~/.config/nvim
Switch at runtime?	‚ùå No	‚ùå No
Can coexist?	‚úÖ Yes (with folder renames or symlinks)	
Easy to migrate later?	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes

Let me know if you want a script to install both or switch them automatically.
