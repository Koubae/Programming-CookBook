* Supervised (classification)
    * features: Height and Weights
    * Labeled data: Gender
    * Task: Given a person heigh and weight, predict gender

* Supervised (regression)
    * features: Square Footage, Rooms
    * Labeled data: Hourse Prioce
    * Task: Given a house's size and nunmber of rooms, predict the selling price

* Unsupervised (Clustering)
    * features: heights and weights of dog breeds
    * Unlabelled data
    * Task: CLuster together the data into similar groups. It is then up to the data scientist to interpret the clusters

* Reinforcement learning
    * Agent-Learning/Decision maker
    * Environment - What agent interacts with
    * Actions -- What the agent can do
