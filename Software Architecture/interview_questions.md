### A/B Testing


- A/B testing is a user experience research methodology. A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment that usually involves two variants, although the concept can be also extended to multiple variants of the same variable
- A/B testing is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.

In an A/B test, you take a webpage or app screen and modify it to create a second version of the same page. This change can be as simple as a single headline, button or be a complete redesign of the page. Then, half of your traffic is shown the original version of the page (known as control or A) and half are shown the modified version of the page (the variation or B).

More than just answering a one-off question or settling a disagreement, A/B testing can be used to continually improve a given experience or improve a single goal like conversion rate optimization (CRO) over time.

#### A/B testing process

* Collect data
* Identify goals
* Generate test hypothesis
* Create different variations
* Run Experiment
* Analyze Results


* Use rel="canonical":  If you run a split test with multiple URLs, you should use the [rel="canonical"](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls) 
* Use 302 redirects instead of 301s

#### A/B Testing metrics

There are three common metrics frameworks you can follow:

* Google’s HEART
* Pirate Metrics (AARRRR) acquisition, activation, retention, referral, and revenue.
* The North Star Metrics framework

##### HEART Framework

* Happiness
* Engagement
* Adoption
* Retention
* Task Success

### General

#### Data Point

Data points are building blocks of data analysis
A data point is a discrete unit of information. In a general sense, any single fact is a data point. The term data point is roughly equivalent to ***datum***, the singular form of data.

Data point can help formulate hypothesis.
