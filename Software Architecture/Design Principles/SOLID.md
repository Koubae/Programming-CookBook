SOLID 
========

For an example check out : 

Principles
----------

### S => Single-responsability
* There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. In other words, every class should have only one responsibility
### O => Open-closed 
* Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
### L => Liskov Substitution
* Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
* If class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.
### I => Interface segregation
* Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
### D => Dependency Inversion
* Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
